# Flask ML Services

A production-ready containerized machine learning service built with Flask, MLflow, and Docker. This service provides real-time product recommendations with automated model training and deployment pipelines.

## 🚀 Features

- **Flask REST API** with ML prediction endpoints
- **MLflow Integration** for model tracking and versioning
- **Docker Containerization** for scalable deployment
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** with automated testing
- **Model Refresh Automation** with daily training capabilities
- **Health Monitoring** and performance metrics
- **Production-ready** error handling and logging

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask, Python 3.9
- **ML Framework**: Scikit-learn, MLflow
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Deployment**: AWS EKS compatible
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, model versioning
